3.	After the registration he has to click on take attendance and then the camera opens and attendance is tracked by face recognition.
4.	In this python project, I have made an attendance system which takes attendance by using face recognition technique. I have also integrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made on python using tkinter.
